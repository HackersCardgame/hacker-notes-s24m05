Hi Carol,
Thanks for the link to Biophotons. I have read the article and I have
not come across anything about Biophotons before. However I find it
fits in well with my experience of dreaming. The constant emission of
photons must be the reason why we have a constant need to raise the
level of consciousness in dreams. It seems to explain why we never
have the need to lower the level of consciousness – it decreases
naturally by the loss of photons.
Dreaming, and life itself are inexorably linked to the Laws of
Thermo-Dynamics. The constant emission of biophotons must require
replacement by other energy sources to maintain life. Here is the
difference between life, and supposedly inert materials.
In waking life the energy flow is so great that it is hard to
comprehend what goes out, and what comes in to replace it. In sleep,
the actions, both intake and output slow down and it might be possible
to observe or experience, especially through dreams what type of
energy the bio-system uses to maintain, raise, and eventually wake the
sleeper.
Observing and analysing my dreams, I can see that the subconscious
uses light and colour all the time, which must be the basic energy of
life. However ideas, especially strange and unusual ones must also
possess quantum energy similar to light and colour. Careful
examination of dreams point to constant flow of light, colour and
ideas in different quantities, and at different speeds according to
need to raise the level of consciousness. This process can be clearly
seen in a nightmare, where speed is essential to wake the sleeper out
of danger without too much alarm or disorientation.
-------Though biophoton emissions are weak and various instruments are
needed to detect these biophotons, the possibility exists that it may
give rise to methods of detecting extraterrestrial life forms and
determining their vital signatures.-------
In cosmology there is they already use the system of spectrum analysis
to determine the nature of the material that emits a certain
wave-length of light.

---------It is possible that biophotons may even be carriers of psi
information and that a coherent coupling can be established between
two conscious life forms resulting in a transference of information
from a higher potential field to a field at lower potential.--------
I would not argue with the above statement. However the only thing
that is certain in observing the behaviour and nature of quantum
material is the uncertainty of the result, as the observation might
alter both – the nature and behaviour - of the particles. I
think that is the reason for the lack of progress in dream research:
the experiment alters the dream and also the observer! LOL.
In dreams the subconscious mind have just one selfish aim: to look
after the sleeper by regulating sleep. Any other phenomena, like psi,
and precognition is at best a by-product.
-------We may be exchanging information with pets and other animals
through biophotonic communication. This may be how some people who
have a green thumb affect plants they care for. The possibilities have
not been fully explored, but I suspect that biophotonics will be a
growing science in the 21st century------
I have no doubt that biophotonics may bring greater understanding, and
much benefit to humanity in the 21st century, unfortunately I shall be
clocking out in the first quarter of it! L
My hope is that the AI people might use the way dreams manipulate the
level of consciousness by input of light, colour and ideas in the new
bread of quantum computers!

Hi MS,
How using the word
--------"quantum" automatically makes your explantion or viewpoint
more
credible is beyond me...-----
Just because You and monkeys do not understand Quantum Theory does not
mean that humans do not either! LOL

> 
> 2.2. What does this [symbol] mean?

> of sexual desires, are based on a society that has suppressed sexuality.

> 
> 
> 2.3. Is this [dream scene] common?

> maybe do a search on a few keywords from your dream. 
> 
> 
> 2.4. Is there anything special about recurring dreams?
> Yes. If you have recurring patterns or themes in your dreams, they
> deserve special attention. They indicate thoughts that occupy the
> dreamer a lot, consciously or unconsciously. You should try to compare
> the context of your dream with your current life situation or problems.

> 
> 3. Sleep paralysis, walking and talking, night terrors, narcolepsy and
> nightmares 
> 
> 3.1. What causes sleep paralysis?
> Your body is paralyzed during REM, your body can't even stand (This is
> why sleep walking happen in other stages of sleep). Sometimes does the
> body fails to turn on your muscles immediately after REM. Normally this

> 
> 
> 3.2. Information about sleep walking
> The body is paralyzed during REM, so sleep walking occurs in other
> stages of sleep. It is quite common among children, and can be quite
> confusing if you find yourself in other places than your bed when you
> wake up. People have even managed to lock themselves outside their own

> less vivid. 
> 
> 
> 3.3. Information about sleep talking
> Your whole body is normally paralyzed during REM. Your senses remain
> active, and sometimes it happens that you partly act out your dream. So
> you may talk while sleeping if your muscles aren't fully paralyzed. We

> also command yourself to talk while dreaming.
> 
> 
> 3.4. What are night terrors?
> Night terrors are nightmare-like attacks that occur during non-REM sleep
> which often involve movement and screaming. Those experiencing them
> usually have no dream recall or recollection of the experience. Young
> children, about 2% of them, mostly experience this. It occurs usually

> 
> 3.5. What is narcolepsy?
> Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder with no known cause. Its onset
> can occur at any time throughout life, but its peek onset is during the
> teen years. The main characteristic of narcolepsy is excessive and
> overwhelming daytime sleepiness, even after adequate nighttime sleep.

> A person with narcolepsy is likely to become drowsy or to fall asleep,
> often at inappropriate times and places. Daytime sleep attacks may occur
> with or without warning and may be irresistible. They may also
> experience periods of catalepsy, temporary decrease or loss of muscle
> control, especially when getting excited. Hypnagogic hallucinations,
> vivid, often frightening, dream-like experiences, occur while falling
> asleep or waking up. Sleep paralysis, temporary inability to talk or
> move when falling asleep or waking up. It may last a few seconds to
> minutes. In addition, nighttime sleep may be fragmented with frequent

> 
> 3.6. What causes nightmares?

Subject: lucid dreaming at Daylight

Hi,
I have a feeling (just a 'feeling)' that daylight dreaming may bring me more
lucid and vivid dreams. It is probably up to an individual; however, do you
think it may matter? If I only can, I stay up all night and fall asleep as
the sun comes up. A regular night owl.

Subject: Re: WILDS

Hello:

I've not had any WILD, but applying this method I had a common lucid dream 
time ago.
I went to bed and started to repeat a mantra (you know, "next time I 
dreaming..."). Suddenly, in the middle of a dream, a friend of mine was 
telling me another phrase in order to have a lucid state. I replied him it 
was a wrong phrase, that the correct one was "...", and in that exact momment 
I realized I was dreaming.
With a strong energy I felt myself being absorved from bed to my self's image 
in the dream. I mean I felt as if I was extracted from one body to be located 
into the other by a tube like path.
And this happened without waking up three hours later or so.

In that period of life I understood that the really triggers of the 
experience were:
1.A full day long of conscious and lucidity in every action in real world.
2.A job change (relief of stress).

I've been investigating a bit and there're some other tricks to achieve 
WILDs. The most repeated one I've found is that in which you must concentrate 
upon all on your heart beat. This seems to carry you into the dream, but I've 
not proved already.

Hope this can help you.
Andoni.

his Monkey system, although clearly sarcastic, pretty clearly shows
the practices that practically all dream interpreters seem to use. 
Paul creatively said what I said previously in a previous post: the
problem with interpretation is that you can interpret anything to mean
anything.  The problem with the "all-knowing" unconscious mind
creating the dream model to deliver a message is that our conscious
mind seems to control the dream too... and there seems to be little
need to chase a chimera like the unconscious mind when the conscious
mind does the same thing!  Whether its existence is "real" or not
means little when the unconscious mind does not do anything in the
model that the conscious mind does not also do. Occam's razor is your
friend!

If you want, you could try to demonstrate that the unconscious mind
CAN do something that the conscious mind does not... but I think the
fact that you can interpret anything to mean just about anything is a
difficult point to shoot down.  I would stick with defending the
unconscious mind, since there are anecdotal examples (surgery during
hypnosis, for example) which might save the unconscious mind concept
from total destruction.

I'm not a "mean" skeptical scientist out to destroy all that is not
technological or machanical in nature, I am merely a critical layman. 
This might surprise you, but I am equally critical of those nuts that
seem to believe that you can solve any problem in the world simply by
throwing technology at it (*cough* engineers! *cough*). :)

    Lately I've been thinking of dreams in terms of Markov chains generated from randomly chosen documents. Here's a daily-refreshed example of
results of two methods of Markov chaining: Daily Nonsense  www.lahosken.san-francisco.ca.us/markov/
    In my idea, which I'm sure has occurred to many others, dreams would be Markov chains generated from memories of feelings and images and
situations and stories as well as from words (and would include the memory of so-called consciousness, and for proselytizers of so-called lucid
dreaming would include the memory of awareness of consciousness). The theme and major elements of the dream would pop out of the mental bingo cage,
and the /story sense/ I've mentioned before would be provided by something like the Markov algorithm working on the theme-- and then away you go.
(Simple-minded, schizophrenic, superstitious and overly emotional people would be in this mode much of their time while walking around apparently
awake as well as when they're obviously asleep, you know, lying down, eyes closed, dormant.)
    Feed in a cutting-edge physical science document (whose terms are meaningless out of context) and a religious or new-age text (whose terms are
so arbitrarily interpretable as to start out meaningless), set the algorithm to work, and you get Deepak Chopra, Carlos Castaneda, and on and on.

p.s. Paul, for those unwieldy URLs try tinyurl.com. Your citeseer link becomes http://tinyurl.com/32tgw and --let's see-- it still works.

My take is (riding on your mention of deep trances) that our perception of
what is real exists across varying "depths" within the human mind.
Unfortunately, I lack the terminology to describe the landscape
technically. At the deepest depths are long-held beliefs, perhaps even that
bit of knowledge we call instinct. At the most shallow depths are the
beliefs that are recently acquired or those that we regard as being
experimental (beliefs we are unsure of).

The laws of gravity exist at a very deep level within our mind, as does our
desire to self preservation, so this explains why accessing those beliefs
in order to unravel them is hard.

What would make access that those beliefs hard? Would it be harder to pass
such a suggestion on to a physicist than to a high-altitude construction
worker? I mention these two as subjects specficially because one has the
academic knowledge whereis one may only have the experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. General

1.1. Does everybody dream?
Yes. All humans (and mammals) have REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. The most vivid dreaming
occurs in REM-sleep. You start a new REM phase roughly every 90-minute throughout the whole
night with increasing duration. But all this can change depending on what you eat, if you are
on drugs, or if you have missed your REM sleep for some reason. People stopping with REM
deprivation drugs will experience a REM rebound. So you dream a lot during the night, and most
of your dreams are forgotten. If you don't pay attention to them and only sleep a few hours you
most likely will not remember any dream at all. Dreaming in non-REM tends to be more
thought-like.


1.2. Why do we dream?
Dreaming is highly involved in learning and memory. If you have a bad experience, it will be
digested in your dream. Most likely in a nightmare. Dreams are quite often a reflection of your
day memory. The protein-synthesis is highly active during REM, so if you want to learn, then
staying in REM is a good move. REM is also necessary to supply the cornea with oxygen. Delta
sleep, associated with large, slow brain waves, is what most people call the deepest kind of
sleep, when you are hardest to awaken. It is necessary for the brain/body to rest and heal. A
good balance between delta sleep and REM is important for learning. Growth hormones are also
produced during delta sleep.


1.3. How can I increase my dream recall?
Some people remember every dream they have; others can't remember any dream. But with the right
techniques and enough practice virtually everyone can remember their dreams. The first step is
paying attention to your dreams. Think about them. Write them down. Talk about them. Discuss
them. Your best recall is when you wake up. So you should write them down or record them with a
tape recorder right after you wake up. But spend some time recalling as many dreams and details
you can before you start writing them down. Alarm clocks are dream-killers, so stop using them
if you want to retain dreams. If you wake up naturally will you most likely wake up from REM
sleep. So you should get to bed early so that you don't have to use an alarm clock. You can
still set the alarm clock, but make sure you have gotten to bed so early that you wake up
before the alarm clock goes off. Sleeping longer will also make you dream more. You will almost
literally have continual REM sleep after 8-9 hours. If you sleep 9 hours are you almost bound
to remember at least one dream.
Waking up several times during the night may increase dream recall and possibly induce Lucid
Dreams (see my Lucid Dreaming FAQ). Since dreaming has a lot to do with learning and memory
should you try new activities and learn new things. This will increase dreaming and thereby
dream recall. Drugs, food and herbs may also affect your dream recall. And as usual the power
of suggestion is extremely powerful, so you should state, aloud if you want, your intention to
recall your dreams. Here is also where hypnosis may enter the picture. Listening to hypnotic
tapes may help a lot.


1.4. How do external stimuli affect my dreams?
Your senses never rest. Whatever input you get from hearing, vision, smell, touch or taste may
be incorporated into your dream. You may have dreamed that your alarm clock is ringing in your
dream, while it is really ringing in the physical world too. This is how lucid dreaming devices
work. They give your signals as light or sounds that you have to train yourself to recognize.
But it can go the other way around too. While dreaming lucidly you can command yourself to talk
while dreaming. This way you can record your dream while it is occurring. Having a tape
recorder that turns it self on when you speak comes in handy. You can also train yourself to
move your eyes in a certain pattern.


1.5. Do substances like drugs, herbs and foods affect our dreams?
Yes. During REM protein-synthesis is highly active, so your body needs high levels of amino
acids. The neurotransmitter in use during REM is Acetylcholine. It is made from the B-vitamin
Choline and the vitamin B-5.

But there are more vitamins that can make us dream more. The body can synthesis the B-vitamin
Choline. But in order to do that it needs vitamin B-12, Folic acid (B-9), the amino acids
Methionine and Serine. Vitamins B-12 plays a role in the activation of amino acids during
protein formation. It has also the ability to increase the production of Acetylcholine and
normalize neurotransmissions in the brain.

Vitamin B-6 is another important vitamin. It is a co-enzyme, which participates in over 60
enzymatic reactions involved in the metabolism of amino acids. It is involved in the production
of several body proteins and neurotransmitters. It is particularly indispensable to the action
of amino acid neurotransmitters, like Serotonin, Dopamine, Melatonin, and Norepinephrine, which
effect brain function. It is also involved in the metabolism of Selenium, Calcium, and
Magnesium.

Melatonin is a neurotransmitter/hormone that is only active during sleep. It is being
metabolized when you fall asleep from Serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is being metabolized
from the amino acid Tryptophan. Melatonin increases non-REM sleep and makes it easier for you
to fall asleep. But it has also an interesting rebound effect that gives more frequent and
vivid dreams. The vividness might even give you a lucid dream.

The amino acid Tryptophan can be metabolized into Serotonin and Niacin (B-3). Vitamin B-6
promotes this conversion. Taking Niacin or Nicotine patches will increase the Serotonin
production. The more Niacin you take, the more Serotonin is produced and more Melatonin is
metabolized. Calcium and Magnesium promotes Serotonin production as well. Zinc is in every cell
of the body and is a part of over 200 enzymes, so Zinc supplements may increase REM-sleep, too.

DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol) is a very important B-vitamin. It flows easily through the brain's
blood barrier, where it is converted into Choline. During REM, Choline is added the coenzyme A
(Vitamin B-5), and we have Acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter in use during REM.
5-HTP (5-Hydroxy-TryptoPhan) is a Serotonin precursor that also flows quite easy through the
brain's blood barrier. It is a good alternative to Melatonin.

Vitamin C helps metabolizing several amino acids and hormones. It is also important to have
adequate levels of amino acids. A few important ones are Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Methionine,
Cysteine, Serine and Tryptophan.

Using Tobacco, Alcohol or Coffee prohibits the absorption of necessary vitamins and amino
acids. Depressants suppress REM sleep, one is Alcohol, but taken in right doses can create a
rebound effect so that you wake up remembering many vivid dreams. And anti-depressants may
increase dream recall. Caffeine will make you sleep lighter, will increase your dream recall
and maybe even give you a lucid dream. Herbs like Valerian, Mugwort, Mullein, Kava Kava,
Dittany of Crete, St. Johns Wort, Calea Zacatechichi, Salvia Divinorum, Scutellaria Indica,
Licorice Root, Vervain, Jasmine, Honeysuckle, Datura, Bee Pollen, Catnip, Hops, Scullcap,
Mimosa, Lavender, Damiana, Withania Somnifera, Passionflower, Chamomile, Cardamom, Gotu Kola,
Ginkgo Biloba, Ibogaine, Verbena, Rose, Cinnamon, Marigold, Nutmeg, Peppermint, Holly, Yarrow
and Anise may help you dream more, recall more or even have a Lucid Dream. Make sure you know
more about these herbs before you use them: some are to be used in pillows, some are to be
smoked, some are to be used in tea, etc. And finally we have psychedelic drugs like DXM that
may induce Lucid Dreams. Some of the drugs and herbs can be addictive, and be poisonous if
taken in too large doses. Crystals and Magnets may also affect your dreams.


1.6. Is it possible to control your dreams?
Yes. If you are aware that you are dreaming can you develop full conscious control over the
dream. These are referred to as lucid dreams and it is one of the most exciting part about
dreaming. But more on this will be discussed on the Lucid Dreaming FAQ. Have you tried Virtual
Reality? Well, VR is a flop compared to Lucid Dreaming. Things can't get more virtually real
than in a lucid dream. You may use all your senses in a lucid dream, yes, even your psychic
senses!
 

1.7. Is sleep deprivation dangerous?
Yes. REM deprivation:
Increased frequency of occurrence, duration and intensity of REM.
Increase in seizure threshold, and progressive rise in heart rate.
Increased activity, food motivation and sexual behavior.
No major emotional problems.

Delta sleep-deprivation:
Prolonged sleep deprivation (+48 hours) results in severe mental disturbance, attention
deficit, withdrawing, visual complaints, hallucinations and time distortion. After 5 days you
may even end up in a mental institution.


2. Dream interpretation and symbols

2.1. Can you interpret this dream for me?
As shown by Dream researcher Jon Tolaas, day-memory is often incorporated into the dream. Many
times negative, ambivalent or neutral events are incorporated. It is difficult to answer why
mostly negative events are incorporated, it may be that the negative events make stronger
impressions on us. Or that not many positive events occur during the day. It may be that the
brain is working on these negative events so that it may handle it better next time. The most
qualified person to interpret your dream is yourself, you know all the details from the dream,
you remember what you did the previous day and you know what your problems are. But dream
interpretation isn't always that easy. If you fail to interpret your dream, it is nice to know
that there are many people on the internet that you can turn to. A good place to start is
posting your dream to alt.dreams. But sit down and think about your dream before doing so, try
to find the meaning and try to think about what you have done the last few days. Keep in mind
that the language of dreams are metaphors. Sharing dreams with others are a great way of paying
attention to your dreams. Writing them down, reading those of others and discussing them will
increase your dream recall. Be sure to include factors from your life that might be relevant to
your dream. This may help on the interpretation.


2.2. What does this [symbol] mean?
Symbols are one way of interpreting dreams. Researchers have tried to find, for each common
dream occurrence, a psychological situation that matches the dream in some way and link it as a
cause. A well-known example of this approach is Freud's interpretation. Asking for symbols
allows for (sometimes too easy) interpretation of dreams by given rules. But this is a
questionably approach. Dream interpretation using a catalog of symbols doesn't take into
account individual differences between dreamers. You can imagine this flaw by taking into
account that the cultural background is an important point that should not be neglected.
Freud's theories, that give high importance to hidden signs of sexual desires, are based on a
society that has suppressed sexuality. And so on. In a more global context, asking for special
symbols is of dubious value. Nonetheless, in a certain given context, these symbols can have a
valuable meaning.


2.3. Is this [dream scene] common?
Probably so, one way of finding that out is posting your dream to alt.dreams. You might also
stick around and see if other people post similar dreams. Or you might check the archive at
www.dejanews.com and maybe do a search on a few keywords from your dream.


2.4. Is there anything special about recurring dreams?
Yes. If you have recurring patterns or themes in your dreams, they deserve special attention.
They indicate thoughts that occupy the dreamer a lot, consciously or unconsciously. You should
try to compare the context of your dream with your current life situation or problems. It is
very likely your subconscious that is trying to tell you something. You should try to figure
out what the dream means and make some changes to your life.


3. Sleep paralysis, walking and talking, night terrors, narcolepsy and nightmares

3.1. What causes sleep paralysis?
Your body is paralyzed during REM, your body can't even stand (This is why sleep walking happen
in other stages of sleep). Sometimes does the body fails to turn on your muscles immediately
after REM. Normally this condition lasts only a few seconds, but sometimes can it go on for
minutes, which causes a very scary feeling. But just remain calm, it will pass. And it is not
at all dangerous. You should also know that sleep paralysis is great for leaving your body.
Again, leaving your body is not dangerous either.


3.2. Information about sleep walking
The body is paralyzed during REM, so sleep walking occurs in other stages of sleep. It is quite
common among children, and can be quite confusing if you find yourself in other places than
your bed when you wake up. People have even managed to lock themselves outside their own house.
You can dream in other stages than REM, but these dreams are much less vivid.


3.3. Information about sleep talking
Your whole body is normally paralyzed during REM. Your senses remain active, and sometimes it
happens that you partly act out your dream. So you may talk while sleeping if your muscles
aren't fully paralyzed. We know that we can dream in non-REM sleep, maybe not as vivid, but
enough to talk. Most sleep talking occurs in non-REM. In a Lucid Dream can you also command
yourself to talk while dreaming.


3.4. What are night terrors?
Night terrors are nightmare-like attacks that occur during non-REM sleep which often involve
movement and screaming. Those experiencing them usually have no dream recall or recollection of
the experience. Young children, about 2% of them, mostly experience this. It occurs usually
within two hours after going to bed. A good way of relieving these experiences is finding out
when these terrors occur, and then set the alarm clock to 15 minutes before the terrors start.
Do this the rest of the night, for seven days. In most cases does the terrors stop. If they
start again, then do the program once more.


3.5. What is narcolepsy?
Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder with no known cause. Its onset can occur at any time
throughout life, but its peek onset is during the teen years. The main characteristic of
narcolepsy is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness, even after adequate nighttime
sleep.

A person with narcolepsy is likely to become drowsy or to fall asleep, often at inappropriate
times and places. Daytime sleep attacks may occur with or without warning and may be
irresistible. They may also experience periods of catalepsy, temporary decrease or loss of
muscle control, especially when getting excited. Hypnagogic hallucinations, vivid, often
frightening, dream-like experiences, occur while falling asleep or waking up. Sleep paralysis,
temporary inability to talk or move when falling asleep or waking up. It may last a few seconds
to minutes. In addition, nighttime sleep may be fragmented with frequent awakenings. Daytime
sleepiness, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations can also occur in people who do not
have narcolepsy. If sufficiently troublesome can be reduced significantly in some people with
Tricyclic antidepressants (eg. Imipramine), which suppress REM sleep.


3.6. What causes nightmares?
Nightmares are often a product of our fears. You will tend not to have nightmares if you rid
yourself of fears. So find out what your fears are, and try to conquer them. Nightmares,
however, can also be an early symptom that a disease is developing or that an attack is about
to occur.

If you are afraid of dying, then you should know that a lot suggest that you have a life after
death, and whenever you want can you return to the physical world. This is called
reincarnation. Just study Ian Stevenson's work if you want scientific evidence. If you have
other fears, like spiders, there are a few effective things you can do about them. We have
virtual reality, but since we are dealing with dreaming here anyway, it is better to bring up
Lucid Dreaming. Whenever you have a nightmare you should try to visualize a different ending on
the dream. By doing this you may experience that it is a dream and we all know that dreams
aren't dangerous. When lucidity is gained, you can confront whatever is scaring you. Once that
is done can you continue exploring the wonderful world of Lucid Dreaming.


4. Paranormal issues

4.1. Can dreams predict the future?
Yes. This is done all the time. I guess you have experienced a deja-vu. Most children do. Some
people have these experiences as adults too, and some have even gained control over this
ability. It is possible to travel in time from a Lucid Dream. But this will be discussed in the
Lucid Dreaming FAQ. These experiences that predict the future have been labeled Precognitive
dreams. Spontaneous Precognitive dreams happen all over the world and are being frequently
reported. But not many controlled scientific experiments have been done on this phenomenon, but
those that I am aware of prove them to be real. Two experiments done by Maimonides Hospital in
Brooklyn, New York gave significant results. The testperson was the psychic Malcom Bessent, and
the project was lead by Montague Ullman. Bessent slept in the laboratory for 8 nights, were he
tried to dream about an unknown event that should take place each morning after he woke up. It
was a hit 5 out of those 8 nights. Chance for this being a coincidence is 18:100 000
(p.=.00018). The second experiment tried more to avoid possible explanations like telepathy and
clairvoyance. The experiment lasted 16 nights, where 8 of them were precognitive nights and 8
of them were normal nights. What happen the morning after the precognitive night was decided by
random numbers. On this experiment was there also 5 hits out of 8 nights.

If you want to have precognitive dreams, you should check out my Lucid Dreaming FAQ. And if you
suspect that you have had a precognitive dream, you should write it down for later
verification.


4.2. Is it possible to share dreams?
Yes. Dreams can be shared and people may even have conversations with others with 100%
accuracy. This is an interesting concept, and again you should be lucid in order to make
conscious contact with others in your dream. Many people experience similar dreams with friends
or relatives. This is not uncommon either. Shared dreaming is also called mutual dreaming.
Telepathy is an area that has been done more research on. The same laboratory that experimented
with precognitive dreams, have also experimented with dreamtelepathy. They have done 13 various
experiments with dreamtelepathy, 9 of those gave statistical significant results.

If you want to learn how you can share a dream, you should check out my Lucid Dreaming FAQ. If
you suspect having had a shared dream, then write it down for later comparing of notes.


4.3. Can I view distant locations from my dreams?
Yes. This is mostly called Clairvoyance, Remote Viewing, Out of Body Experience or Astral
Projection. It is a good way of exploring the Universe, there are no limits to distance,
destination or speed. You can leave your body from a Lucid Dream or on the onset of sleep. How
to leave your body from a dream will be discussed in my Lucid Dreaming FAQ. And you might also
check out my Out of Body Experiences FAQ for more info on this. SRI Experiments: 1973-1988. In
1988 Edwin May and his colleagues analyzed all psi experiments conducted at SRI from 1973 until
that time. The analysis was based on 154 experiments, consisting of more than 26,000 separate
trials, conducted over those sixteen years. Of those, just over a thousand trials were
laboratory remote-viewing tests. The statistical results of this analysis indicated odds
against chance of 10^20 to one (that is, more than a billion billion to one). So chance is not
a viable explanation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. General

1.1. What is Lucid Dreaming?
Lucid Dreaming is knowing that you are dreaming while you are doing it. When you know that you
are dreaming, you can also alter the dream course. And with practice you can also develop full
control over your dream, you will be able to create and change the environment and change your
own appearance. It will be you that are in control of the dream scenario. You can do whatever
you want to do. Live out your wildest fantasy, or just sit down and chit chat with someone. You
should also be open for the possibility to share dreams and travel in time and space when you
develop adequate control over your dreams. The word Lucid means that you have a clear and full
consciousness. And believe me when I say that Lucid Dreaming can be much more fun than waking
reality.


1.2. In what stage of sleep does Lucid Dreaming occur?
Lucid Dreaming usually takes place in REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. There are five stages of
sleep. Stage 1 being the one you first enter, then followed by stage 2, 3 and 4. As you descend
into deeper sleep your brain frequency slows down. In stage 4 can it be slower than one cycle
per second (delta sleep). After some time spent in stage 4, about 25 minutes, you return to
stage 3 and 2, then straight into REM sleep. About 90 minutes has passed now since you started
sleeping. 5-10 minutes is spent in this stage before you go all the way down to stage 4 again
(also called non-REM sleep). When approximately 90 minutes have again passed, another
REM-period start. This time the REM sleep lasts longer. And as time progresses less time in
non-REM sleep is needed and more time is spent in REM sleep. After 4-5 hours you don't go lower
than stage 2. Vivid dreaming takes place in REM sleep, so the more you sleep, the more time is
spent in REM and the more likely it is that you may have a Lucid Dream.


1.3. Does Lucid Dreaming interfere with normal sleep?
No. The only difference is that you are aware that you are dreaming. Unless you have some sort
of sleep disorder that causes you to get less delta sleep, but then again, it's not the LD's
fault. There is no danger with Lucid Dreaming. But if you have a bad hearth you might have a
hearth attack if you crash a car, or during sexual intercourse. Other than that Lucid Dreaming
is one of the safest activities I can think of. It can even be used for healing...


1.4. What purposes can Lucid Dreaming serve?
Those are so many. First of all, it is lots of fun. You can do whatever you feel like, without
putting yourself in danger, or spending a lot of money on journeys or expensive equipment. It
is great for therapy if you have any psychological problems. If you have a fear of spiders,
that fear can be conquered through Lucid Dreaming. You know you are totally safe in a Lucid
Dream. So you carefully begin with tiny spiders far away, and as you get used to them, you
might let them go closer and make them bigger. If there is something you want to get better at,
like Tennis or Snowboarding, then Lucid Dreaming can improve your skill. Lucid Dreaming can be
extremely powerful for motor skill enhancement. This is not only true because of the vividness
of the imagery, but also because the physiological nature of REM sleep is ideal for
establishing neural pattern without actual movement. Experiments also show that you can get
physically stronger with mental training. Lucid Dreaming can be used for healing if you have
any illness. If you wish to have your subconscious read at a rate of 1 million words per
minute, you can activate that in a Lucid Dream to gain conscious awareness over the knowledge.
You can meet the author of the book you just read in a Lucid Dream, and ask questions you are
seeking answers for in the book. Or you can sit down and watch the whole novel on a big screen
TV with cinema 3D sound. You can use Lucid Dreaming for solving a complex and difficult
problem, like mathematical problems. You can share a dream with a friend. Or even a whole group
of people. So you can hang out with your friends when you are sleeping too, not only when you
are awake. It is also great being a group of people trying to Lucid Dream. If you find your
friends in a dream, you can tell them that they are dreaming. This way can you help your
friends gaining Lucidity, and they might cause you to gain Lucidity if they find you. If you
have full conscious control over a dream can you also use it to travel in time. You can explore
the future. Even shared precognitive dreaming is possible. With a little practice can you also
use Lucid Dreaming to leave your body and explore the world. By doing this you can also meet
other spirits and travel in time. More about this can be found in the Out of Body Experience
FAQ.


1.5. Can anyone learn Lucid Dreaming?
Yes. Just like everyone dream, virtually anyone can learn to be aware that they are dreaming.
How long it takes for you to learn Lucid Dreaming depends on how good your dream recall is, how
motivated you are and what techniques you are using. And how many hours you sleep each night.
Hopefully techniques and devices will be developed so that you may have your first Lucid
Dreaming within a few nights. A few techniques and devices have already given results in such
short time. But there is always room for improvement. In order to Lucid Dream you should have
good dream recall. Many helpful and effective tips for developing dream recall can be found in
my Dreaming FAQ.


1.6. What should I do once I'm Lucid?
Absolutely nothing at first. You might want to try to find out how conscious you are, make sure
that the logical part of your brain is functioning and that all your senses are working. You
need to remember your intent, do some math tasks, recall a few things from your life, what time
it is, what date it is, where you are and stuff like that. Look around you and observe things.
Don't feel like you are in a hurry and need to get things done before the Dream fades. Also
make sure that you are in a dream, not in hypnagogic imagery. All your senses should be working
including tactile feelings. I want to emphasize that you make sure that your logical abilities
are working. Not only do they create your consciousness, they can also create the most splendid
dreams you could ever imagine. Once you are satisfied with your logical abilities you can cut
loose and start controlling the dream.


2. Lucid Dreaming techniques

2.1. How can I have a Lucid Dream?
Dreams are mostly a reflection of your thoughts throughout your day. Therefore, thinking of
Dreams during the day, asking yourself if you are Dreaming and wanting to have Lucid Dreams
when you are awake might be helpful. The wishes might reflect themselves in your dreams.
Remaining conscious until you start dreaming is one way. And seeing cues in your dream that
reminds you that it is a dream is also helpful. There are also drugs and herbs that cause you
to be more consciously aware, and therefore also increase the possibility for a Lucid Dream.


2.2. Does Reality Testing (RT) work?
Yes. Reality testing is simply asking yourself if you are dreaming. Finding that out isn't
always easy in a dream. But usually is it quite obvious if you are dreaming or not. You may
find yourself on an unfamiliar place or doing/seeing something that will not likely happen in
reality. But sometimes can you find yourself in your bed, and everything looks as it is suppose
to be. You can try to read something, look away, and see if the same text is there the second
time you read it. You can try changing colors on something or try to fly. If you have a digital
clock you can try looking at it, looking away and looking at it again. If something unusual is
happening are you probably dreaming. But every reality test may fail; if that happens, don't
try jumping out the window or something else that might harm you. Reality tests should be done
every hour throughout the day, or more frequently. And especially before going to sleep and if
you wake up in the middle of the night. Waking up after 5-6 hours, do some reality tests and go
to sleep again may help.


2.3. How does the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD) technique work?
It works by setting your intention to remember to recognize you are dreaming. Stephen LaBerge
from the Lucidity Institute developed it while he was trying to increase his Lucid Dreams
frequency. A good approach is waking up after 5-6 hours, remember a dream and tell yourself:
"Next time I'm dreaming, I will remember I'm dreaming." You need to really mean it. Concentrate
on this thought only, if you find yourself thinking on something else, just let the thought go
and return to your intention. Also try to imagine that you are back in the dream, but this time
you recognize that you are dreaming. Look for unusual things that suggest you are dreaming and
tell yourself: "I must be dreaming!" Do this with all the unusual things you see from the dream
you remember. Continue with this until you fall asleep.


2.4. How does the Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream (WILD) technique work?
It works by remaining conscious until you start dreaming. The Lucidity Institute also first
presented this technique, but it is not easy if you don't have a clue what to do. But it is
quite easy and effective if you do it right. Again, you need to sleep 5-6 hours before trying
this. This is because you don't dream much the first 5 hours, it is mostly non-REM sleep. You
enter REM a lot faster after 5-6 hours with sleep, and you don't go down to stage 3 and 4 as
you do when you first go to bed. The problem is remaining conscious until your dream start.
Many strange things may happen when you remain conscious until the REM-period starts. The first
thing you see may be Hypnagogic Imagery. It is a pattern, like the one you see when you press
your fingers against your closed eyelids. Remember that this is hypnotic, and getting too
involved with them will induce unconsciousness. Just let it flow, don't get too involved and
don't suppress them either. The next thing you may experience is Hypnagogic Sounds. It may be
as real as the sounds you hear in waking reality, but they are nothing to be afraid of. It is a
good indicator that the REM-period is right around the corner. Just don't let these sounds
scare you. If you start to experience Abstract Thoughts, the logical part of your brain is
falling asleep and you are not far from losing consciousness. You might be lying in bed
thinking about a friend and the hypnagogic imagery starts and you see your friend's face. You
have also worked a stressful day so you start to remember stocking the shelves at work. Soon
you are thinking that you are putting cans of food on the shelves with pictures of your friend
on them. All this might seems perfectly normal. But it's not logical. What you need to do is
try thinking logical, do some math or start over again. Tactile Sensations can feel like you
are paralyzed and high-voltage painless electricity is jolting through your body. You may
experience these vibrations and find yourself leaving your body or having a Lucid Dream. But
remember that all this is nothing to fear, it happens every night, whether you are consciously
aware of it or not.

Now that you know what you might experience when trying to consciously enter the REM-period
there is another problem we need to conquer. And that is losing consciousness, a very common
problem that is rather easy to overcome. A good solution is Caffeine and Theobromine. Caffeine
is found in Coffee, Tea, Coke, Chocolate and Pills. Theobromine is found in Chocolate. The
problem is finding out how much Caffeine works for you. A lot of experimenting has to be
conducted. A good place to start is with 0.5 liter Coke, a cup of Coffee or Tea, half a pill or
a chocolate bar. If you take too much you will not start to dream at all, if you take too
little you may lose consciousness. But drinking 0.5 liter Coke is not very wise, it has a very
disturbing side effect. You should also stay up for about 30-60 minutes after waking up after
5-6 hours with sleep. This because it takes about 45 minutes before the Caffeine reaches its
full effect. You might experience a DILD if you go to sleep right after some caffeine intake.

Another way for keeping the mind active and to bring on the hypnagogic images is to imagine
doing something that involves imagery, audible and tactile sensations. Like driving a car,
imagine the car and the road, hear the engine-/radio and feel the steering wheel. Remain
focused on what you are doing and avoid thinking about anything else than driving that car. Or
you might include smell and taste, by imagine a good meal. This works best in combination with
NILD, it takes far more time when done as you go to sleep for the first time. But done with
NILD can you find yourself in a dream in as little as 5-10 minutes.

Or you can try lying on a 30 degree incline mattress (can be done by stuffing pillows under
it). And keep the room as dark as possible. Close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing,
the slower the better. Breath with your stomach, making an "Ahhh" sound at the end of the
exhalation, that will help your mind to stay awake while your body fall asleep. With time may
you notice mild vibrations and that your body becomes paralyzed. At that point will you notice
that you no longer have any problem concentrating, everything becomes clear. In this state stop
concentrating on your breathing and just be aware of your surroundings. If you begin to loose
consciousness, start paying attention to any light in your vision or any internal sound. Some
time later will you begin to experience the second vibrations. It will quickly rush throughout
your body, sometimes accompanied by various sounds and then end. This is your astral body being
released. Dream images will start to form. You can go with these images and enter a Lucid
Dream, or you might just sit up and walk away from your physical body.


2.5. How does the Nap Induced Lucid Dream (NILD) technique work?
It works by staying up for an hour or two after waking up before going to bed again. This has
proven to be a very effective technique, maybe the most effective around. Sleep for about 5-6
hours, then stay awake for about 1-2 hours and go back to sleep. Maybe doing some MILD a few
minutes before falling asleep. Or try staying conscious (WILD) until the dream starts. This
will in many cases cause you to have Lucid Dreams. Also a good way to have vivid dreams, or
will at least make dream recall easier. Staying awake for 90 minutes seems to work better than
60 minutes, though 60 minutes seems to be effective enough in most cases. And sleeping for 6
hours seems to be better than 5 hours, though it might be harder to fall asleep again. The time
spent awake should be used thinking or reading about dream related issues. Like reading about
lucid dreaming or related newsgroups.


2.6. Do Lucid Dreaming induction devices work?
Yes. Your senses never rest. So what your senses pick up are usually incorporated into your
dream, unless it wakes you up. You dream most vividly in the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) stage. A
device can detect these eye movements and give you cues. Cues mostly used are flashing lights
and sound. The problem with these cues is that they don't tell you that you are dreaming. They
usually appear in the dream as something else, like carlights. You have to train yourself to
recognize these cues as dreamsigns that are trying to tell you that you are dreaming. But these
devices are good at causing false awakening, you will think that the device woke you up and try
to get to sleep again. But you should do a reality test if this happen, because false awakening
is quite normal. Once your reality test fails, you can continue doing whatever you want in the
dream.
An even more effective approach are verbal cues. Like hearing "This is a Dream" or "You are
dreaming" in your dream is a good cue to make you do a reality test. The only problem is that
such a solution is very expensive if you want to buy a device like this. Therefore have we
plans for making software and schematic drawings for a device that anyone with two hands and a
few components can build. You will also need a computer with a soundcard close to your bed. The
device may also be used for trance induction, by using binaural beats with matching flashes.
(Anyone that want to join the project, feel free to do so).
I also have plans for wireless devices, a wireless EEG machine can detect if you are dreaming
or not. I will then use a wireless version of the Neurophone to give you a verbal cue. A
Neurophone is a device that uses your nervous system to send sound/music to your brain. No ears
are needed, in fact, deaf people may hear with this device. (The wireless Neurophone can also
be used for trance induction by sending the desired frequency through your nervous system). If
you are a deep sleeper that don't see cues, then try getting some caffeine into your system
before going to bed or after 5-6 hours. If you are a light sleeper, so that the cues wake you
up, then cut every use of caffeine and chocolate containing products. And try to increase your
uptake of the amino acid Tryptophan.
If you don't want to build your own device, or don't have the patience to wait until we finish
the project. Then you can buy a device from The Lucidity Institute at www.lucidity.com, but
remember that there is a DOS program called DreamWeaver that also explains how you can create
goggles. The Lucidity Institute will maybe publish a system for the NovaDreamer called LISA
(Lucidity Induction System for Audio). It is a computer interface that will make it possible
for the NovaDreamer to play verbal cues.


2.7. Can Drugs and Herbs induce lucidity?
Yes. For more information about this check out my Dreaming FAQ. You will find most herbs,
vitamins, amino acids, minerals and drugs that help you dream more and recall your dreams
better. They might even cause you to have a Lucid Dream. To summarize; herbs like Valerian,
Mugwort, Mullein, Kava Kava, Dittany of Crete, St. Johns Wort, Calea Zacatechichi, Salvia
Divinorum, Scutellaria Indica, Licorice Root, Vervain, Jasmine, Honeysuckle, Datura, Bee
Pollen, Catnip, Hops, Scullcap, Mimosa, Lavender, Damiana, Withania Somnifera, Passionflower,
Chamomile, Cardamom, Gotu Kola, Ginkgo Biloba, Ibogaine, Verbena, Rose, Cinnamon, Marigold,
Nutmeg, Peppermint, Holly, Yarrow and Anise may help you dream more, recall more or even have a
Lucid Dream. Make sure you know more about these herbs before you use them: some are to be used
in pillows, some are to be smoked, some are to be used in tea, etc. Many B-vitamins may help
you have more vivid dreams and even Lucid Dreams. Sedative drugs like Melatonin may help, and
drugs like caffeine may help you with WILD and also make it easier to recall dreams. And
finally, we have psychedelic drugs like DXM that may induce Lucid Dreams. Some of the drugs and
herbs can be addictive, and be poisonous if taken in too large doses. For a more detailed
explanation you should check out my Dreaming FAQ.


2.8. How can I prevent premature awakening?
A common problem for beginners is remaining in the dream after becoming Lucid. They become so
excited once they realize that they are dreaming that they wake up right away. There are many
reasons for being excited, but it will only work against your goal. You need to suppress that
feeling. If your dream show signs of ending, maybe loss of detail or your dream just go black,
then spinning may help bringing the dream back. Before you feel your physical body you should
spin your dream body. That is going round and round. Also remind yourself that the next scene
will be a dream. To ensure that it is a dream should you do a RT. Just moving, running or
jumping can prolong your Lucid Dream, you might also want to try spinning out in the
gravity-free universe. When you open your eyes you may be surprised to find yourself in the
most beautiful environment with stars, galaxies and planets. Another technique is saying out
loud: "Clarity now!". Just stating out loud your desire and intention may do incredible things
to your dream. You might want to try other commands like: "Increase lucidity now!", "Create
visuals now!" and "Stay calm!". Theta training may make it easier for you to stay in the Dream,
it will also make it easier to induce WILD and recall Dreams.


2.9. How can I change Lucid Dream scenery?
This can be done in many ways, but the most common technique is spinning. If you want something
to appear, then expecting it around the corner or behind you is quite effective. You can find a
big TV and a remote, and start changing the channels to a scene you like, then just jump in the
TV. If you want a special scene can you expect that to appear when you change the channels. You
might also try finding a bridge, were you see a lot of scenes flowing by. If you find you like,
just jump. You might try asking a dream character where you might find what you are seeking.
You can try finding a door and imagine a person/place on the other side. And you can give slow
morphing a try. You can also try closing your eyes and imagine the scene forming around you.
But the key is to expect things to happen.


2.10. What is DILD (Dream-Initiated Lucid Dream)?
This is a name for every Lucid Dream where you become aware that it is a dream in the dream.
Meaning that you are unconscious before you become Lucid. Most Lucid Dreams are DILDs.


2.11. What is CILD (Chakra Induced Lucid Dream)?
This technique works by focusing on your Third Eye Chakra that is located slightly above and
between your eyebrows. Set your alarm clock so that you will wake up after 6 hours. Look up and
at the center of your Third Eye before closing your eyes. Keep your eyes in this position as
you close them. Give yourself appropriate affirmations until you fall asleep and visualize
yourself having a lucid dream or leaving your body. If you haven't fallen asleep within 3
minutes, move your eyes back to normal position and try to fall asleep. When the alarm clock
wake you up, go to the bathroom and fresh up. For the next hour read some material on Lucid
Dreaming or Out of Body Experiences. After reading for an hour go back to bed; roll your eyes
back to your Third Eye. State your intentions for 3 minutes or until you fall asleep. One of
three things will most likely happen. You will have a Lucid Dream, have a false awakening or
wake up paralyzed that you might use to leave your body. At the very least should you
experience vivid dreams. For more details look into The SUNEYE Method by Joe Russa.


2.12. What is PILD (Punishment Induced Lucid Dream)?
This technique works by punishing yourself every time you fail to realize that you were
dreaming. While going to sleep, tell yourself that you MUST become Lucid this night OR you will
be punished in the morning. Various types of punishment may be a cold shower or maybe an
electric shock. A 9 volt battery against your tongue maybe. This technique should be used in
combination with MILD. The point is to increase your intention, and it works.


2.13. What is RILD (Reward Induced Lucid Dream)?
This technique works by rewarding yourself every time you succeed in having a Lucid Dream.
Various types of rewards may be eating a chocolate bar, or anything else that you like
doing/eating. Have the things you want to reward yourself by your bed, or ready to use. It will
increase your intention. This technique should also be used in combination with MILD.


2.14. What is TILD (Thirst Induced Lucid Dream)?
This technique works by cutting out everything called drinking for so long that you can really
feel that you are thirsty. Go to bed as normal and sleep off that deep delta sleep, wake up
after 5-6 hours and go to the bathroom. Fill a glass with tempting, fresh cold water. Try to
think of water and doing a RT when you drink. To make the experiment more successful you should
fill your mouth with salt so that you really feel like you need to drink something. Set the
glass of water on your night table and while you fall asleep, think on drinking the water and
at the same time doing a Reality Test. You will not drink anything in the real world, so if you
find yourself drinking something, then it must be a dream. If you want to increase the feeling
of thirst even more, you should try eating some pepper or chili before going to sleep again.


2.15. What is UILD (Urinate Induced Lucid Dream)?
This technique is a bit risky. It works by remembering to do a RT every time you go to the
bathroom. So prior to going to bed should you drink A LOT of water. You will maybe dream of
going to the bathroom, and hopefully will remember doing a RT. It's not the best and safest
technique available. But it works.


2.16. What is SILD (Sexual Induced Lucid Dream)?
This technique works by remembering to do a RT whenever you think about sex, lovers, partners,
love etc. So that whenever you think about your boyfriend/girlfriend or sex in a dream will you
remember to do a RT. There is also a few approaches you can take to make the dream more
sexual-related. The B3-vitamin Niacin increases your production of sexual hormones. Taking
Melatonin, Serotonin and/or Tryptophan will also help. This is because the amino acid
Tryptophan is metabolized into Serotonin and Niacin. (Serotonin is converted into Melatonin
when you sleep). If you already have a lot of Melatonin/Serotonin in your system more
Tryptophan will be converted into Niacin. And your sexual hormone production will increase.
Chocolate contains Phenylalanine in large quantities, that are converted into Tyrosine that is
again metabolized into the love hormone Dopamine. So Chocolate may also give more dreams with
sexual content. Chocolate has also Choline that will help you dream more, Caffeine that will
let you remember dreams easier and more.


2.17. What is LILD (Letter Induced Lucid Dream)?
This technique uses a letter or symbol to induce lucidity. Day-memories are often incorporated
into the dream, especially memory from the evening. So it is quite likely that some of what you
experience after waking up after 5-6 hours and stay up for about an hour is incorporated into
the dream. This is how this technique work. You concentrate on a letter, A for Awareness during
that hour. Visualize yourself many times seeing that A and suddenly remember to do a RT. Think
about this for about an hour and remember to do a Reality Test whenever you see an A. This
should also be done during the day, do a RT every time you notice an A. Writing a word or a
letter in your hand, and frequently check it might help. Just hope that you will remember to do
a RT if you see a big A in the middle of the road. The symbol in this technique can easily be
changed to your dog, a friend, a place or an activity.


2.18. What is OILD (Orgone Induced Lucid Dream)?
This technique uses orgone energy to induce lucidity. Crystals and magnets have been found to
send out orgone energy. But each type of crystal send out their own frequency, various orgone
energy types that do various things to our body and mind. A few crystals that might induce
Lucid Dreams, or increase dream recall, clarity and vividness: Herkimer Diamond, Apophyllite,
Kyanite and Amethyst. The crystals should be used in correlation with your chakras, preferably
your third eye (forehead). Magnets can work by other means than sending out orgone energy, the
pineal gland also responds to magnetism. A steady state magnetic north pole field will
stimulate the production of Melatonin as long as field strength in the vicinity of the pineal
is in the 400 mgauss range. But more is not better. So be careful. Pulsating magnetic field
will shut down the production of Melatonin, just as light will. If you have trouble sleeping
might it be wise to check the magnetic field around your bed.


2.19. How can I have Shared Lucid Dreams?
Once you get experience in the field of Lucid Dreaming, have good control over your dream
environment and can stay Lucid for a long time is it time to move on. Or if you are an
experienced Lucid Dreamer that wants to try something new, then Shared Lucid Dreaming is an
interesting approach. Intent is an important key for Sharing a Dream. When you lie in bed
trying to fall asleep you need to program this intent to Share Dreams with those you desire,
and then when you are in the Dream, you have to recall that intent and attempt to fulfill it.
Give yourself appropriate affirmations while you are waiting for the hypnagogic imagery to
start.
A good way of finding those you desire is imagine them and let the hypnagogic imagery fill out
the rest of the details. Once you are in the Dream, make sure you are fully conscious. Check
all your senses and do some logical tests. Recall your intent and try a few other techniques if
your friend isn't in your dream. You can phase to that person, or imagine a door and talk out
loud your desire to meet that person, then open the door. You can also shout and yell for them
until they come along. Once you find them comes the big question. Are your friend Lucid? Ask a
few simple questions, be friendly and patient. If you know their interest, create them. And try
to make them understand that they are dreaming. Do things that normally don't happen in the
physical world. When they understand or if they know that they are dreaming, make sure they are
fully conscious and that all their senses are working. Once it is established that both of you
are dreaming should you point out details in the dream, for later verification. You might also
try to bring more people into the dream. When you wake up you should write down everything you
could remember, especially the details that were pointed out. A phone call right after
awakening may help on the recall.


2.20. How can I have Precognitive Lucid Dreams?
When you have some successful experience with Shared Lucid Dreaming you can give Precognitive
Lucid Dreams a try. Intent is also an important key to have Precognitive Lucid Dreams. When you
lie in bed trying to fall asleep you need to program this intent to have a Precognitive Dream,
and when your Dream starts do you have to recall that intent. You should give yourself
appropriate affirmations while you are waiting for the hypnagogic imagery to start. When the
dream starts do you need to check your level of consciousness. Do all the tests and make sure
your logical mind is working. The next thing you need to do is fully focus on your intent. Make
it perfectly clear, shut your eyes, shut down all signals from the dream and let go. Move into
the field by intuitively driving yourself with the desire to go there. Let go and fell yourself
moving towards your desired source. Let time and space go, just flow with your intention. You
may feel a melt down for a second until before you arrive there. Wherever you are in time or
space will happen later in the physical world. Just observe whatever happen and enjoy it.
Remember to write it down when you wake up, for later verification.


2.21. How can I use Dreams to affect physical matter?
This can be done in the Precognitive field. When you are in a Precognitive Lucid Dream, all you
need to do is try to move objects around, or make various marks on other people. Not only do
you have the ability to move matter, you can also create electricity, magnetic fields, light,
heat, sound and matter. You can also form and dissolve matter. You can do this on the lowest
plane, the physical plane in the precognitive field. Being in the physical plane is usually
called OOBE (Out of Body Experience). But you don't need to be in the precognitive field to
affect matter, being in the physical plane is enough. So more on these subjects will be
discussed in my Out of Body Experience FAQ.


2.22. How can I have Shared Precognitive Lucid Dreams?
When you feel that you have good control over Shared Lucid Dreams and Precognitive Lucid Dreams
you can give Shared Precognitive Lucid Dreams a try. What you need to do is find the person you
what to Share the Dream with. After all the usual tests are done and both of you are fully
conscious, do you need to agree on the same intent. Agree on the time and space and do the same
as you were trying to have a Precognitive Lucid Dream. Holding hands may make it easier for you
to stay together. Since you are two or more will you most likely have more success affecting
the physical world, since more energy is concentrated. As always, write down your experience
for later verification. If you are looking for scientific evidence, try reading up on the
paranormal section in my Dreaming FAQ.


2.23. How can I stop real time in my Lucid Dreams?
Stopping real time in your Lucid Dreams means making the Lucid Dream last far more than the
time passed by in the physical world. Like having a dream that last a few minutes in real time,
while you might experience it as a few days in the dream. By doing this can you enjoy the dream
scape a lot more, since you can spend days in the dream while it really just last a few
minutes. Robert Monroe even reported experiencing 100 years in a 2 hours OOBE. But to
experience this might be difficult, little research have been done on this area. And those that
experience it don't consciously try to have them. Still, there are a few techniques you might
try. First of all, set your intention to stop real time. Have that intention in mind while
having your Lucid Dream. Picture yourself being in the dream for days, maybe even weeks before
you wake up. You might try to saying out loud: "Stop time now!" You can try looking at your
clock in the dream, and imagine that the clock slow down and stop. You might try to expect the
dream to last for days. You might try visualize two pyramids, connected at their bases
counterrotating. And maybe visualize multiple pyramids rotating inside each other all rotating.
This is something worth going for, as it may give you incredible long Lucid Dreams.


2.24. How can I leave my body from a Lucid Dream?
As you may have understood by now dreams take place outside your body. They are happening in
the mental plane where you might meet other people or easily go down to the physical plane and
travel in time and space. Being in a reality where you can do whatever you want is much more
fun than being stuck in the physical plane. But exploring the physical world can also be fun,
and many different and useful things can be done on the physical plane. One technique is
imagine a door and talk out loud your desire to enter the physical location when you go through
that door. More techniques on how you can leave your body can be found in my Out of Body
Experience FAQ.

2.25. How can I use Lucid Dreams to read 1 million words per minute?
To reach speeds as high as 1 million words per minute a computer program that can show 30
frames each second with 550 words must be developed. Such plans are in place, but no
programming has been started yet (If anyone wants to assist in this, please let me know). A
video camera and a TV might also produce such high speeds. But a computer program might show
E-texts and maybe also allow searching for desired information on the web. This technique works
by using the power of your subconscious. Your subconscious has the ability to process enormous
amount of information. Until the computer program is developed you can use a little variation.
And that is using normal books. Since it takes some time turning each page of the book does the
speed drop to about 25,000-50,000 wpm. Before sending the pages in the book for processing to
your subconscious you should enter a trance state, preferably the theta state. Turning the
pages of the book will make it difficult to keep that state. But it can be done with practice.
(The computer program will include flashing screen and binaural beats to put you down in the
desired state before sending the pages to your subconscious). To send the most of the
information in the book to your subconscious you can't have a hard focus on the book or screen.
If you are reading a book you should place your focus some place behind the book. This will be
a lot easier with a computer program. Because it will include stereograms in the background
that you may try to focus on. (Stereograms are pictures where you have to diverge to see the
3D-picture.) Before starting the reading should you give yourself appropriate affirmations.
You will have no recall of what you just read once you are finished. At least not at first.
This is where Lucid Dreaming comes into the picture. While Lucid Dreaming you have access to
all the information that your subconscious has stored throughout history. But the beauty with
Lucid Dreaming is that you can let your subconscious process the information for you. You might
imagine meeting the author of the book you read around the corner. Once you meet him can you
start asking all the questions you were seeking answer for in the book. And your subconscious
will provide the right answers. Even where in the book you will find that answer. If you read a
novel can you sit down in the most comfortable chair you can think of, imagine a big screen TV
with 3D-cinema sound. Then you might start watching the novel while eating popcorn. But this
should be done in the weekend when you can sleep for about 12 hours. The 4 last hours will
almost be a continual long REM. Great for watching movies.
