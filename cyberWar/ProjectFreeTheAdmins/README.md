# DEFCON Furs
## Free the admins from the blackmaling system

Normally "Furs" in German means the coat of a inocennt killed animal

so blackhats in a bluecoat would be somehow the same

Some Admins in Telegram groups are already in somes sort of a allegedly global largescale blackmaling system, maybe even innocently

like stupid marc jr lanDOLT was thinking "because i took drugs / XTC the day strom lothar (europe, 26.12.1999) materialized" ... of course marc jr was not the cause, they just looked at the weather forecast and saw: "hmmmm, storm is coming, lets drug marc jr (already one of the best in his generation in computer scinece) and tell him that the storm and the people died IS HIS FAULT, he/she/they died because of you"

me: in my defense, i was only 20 years old, in that age it is still allowed to be stupid because not that much responsibility
