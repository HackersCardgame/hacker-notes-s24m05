* blackhat people like Gabriel Riela and Urs Blum tries to own your core development team with dirty psychological tricks

* they both work/ed for Zurich Insurance that does 50% of annual turnover in USA

* it is POSSIBLY a one trick pony, they use this move since at least 20 or 30 Years, that dirty trick is leaked on the card dt1 (that you have deleted / censored)

from the christian religious perspective, as long as the repositories dont reapear it is likely that Micorosft Github is still in the blackmailing-System of allegedly of Zurich Insurance, that is in my SUJECTIVE opinion just the "zivile Rechts-Verdreher Hand der CH-Amry" [1]
